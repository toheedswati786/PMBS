</h3><!-- /.service-details__title -->
                        <p class="service-details__text">Credentialing and enrollment are vital for healthcare providers as they enable authorization and recognition from insurance companies. By completing the credentialing process, providers demonstrate their qualifications and compliance with industry standards. Enrollment with insurance companies ensures that providers can offer services to patients covered by insurance and receive reimbursement. Without proper credentialing and enrollment, providers may face limitations in their ability to deliver care and may not receive adequate compensation for their services.
