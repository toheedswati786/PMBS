                        <p class="service-details__text">Denial management can be difficult and time-consuming, but with PMBS, you can be certain that your denied claims are in good hands. Our team of specialists is familiar with the most recent best practices for denial management and has a track record of assisting healthcare providers in recovering lost revenue.</p><!-- /.service-details__text -->
                        <p class="service-details__text">Denial management is essential to medical billing because it ensures that healthcare providers get paid what they are owed. According to the Healthcare Financial Management Association, the average healthcare provider experiences a denial rate of 5-10% of their total claims submitted. This can cause providers to lose a lot of money, so managing denials is important in staying financially stable.</p><!-- /.service-details__text -->
